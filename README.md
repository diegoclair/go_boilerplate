## Description ✈️
This project is a boilerplate for creating API projects in Go, incorporating key principles of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture. It reflects my expertise in Golang, drawn from previous projects, and is structured to facilitate maintainability and scalability.

All layers of the codebase are tested to ensure reliability and robustness. The project is open to contributions and improvements. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to discuss enhancements or report bugs.
  
### Project architecture:
<div align="center">

</div>

For the presentation layer, which I refer to as the transport layer, its purpose is to handle data transportation. It is responsible for receiving and responding to various types of requests, including API calls, gRPC, and messaging via RMQ, among others.

## ▶️ Getting Started 💻 

### ❗ First of all:
* You need to have docker installed in your computer.
* Run the command `chmod +x .docker/entrypoint.sh` to give permissions to execute the entrypoint file.

### Start ▶️
To start the applciation, you need just to run the command `docker-compose up`. When you see this message `your server started on [::]:5000` so your app is running correctly!

### 📝 Docs:
Inside of the `/docs` folder, you can see the Swagger documentation of the API Endpoints.
